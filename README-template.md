## Overview
I created a preview blog card using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio. The card design features a clean and modern layout, designed to display a blog post's title, image, and brief description. Using HTML, I structured the elements of the card, including the title, an image placeholder, and text content. With CSS, I styled the card for a visually appealing, responsive look, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes. The result is a sleek, user-friendly blog preview card that can be easily integrated into any website or blog platform.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS
- VS Code
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to implement the **hover** feature in CSS, which enhanced the interactivity of links by enabling dynamic visual feedback when the user interacts with them. This allowed me to create a more engaging user experience. Additionally, I utilized **drop-shadow** effects to add depth to elements, making the design visually stand out and creating a more polished and modern look on the page. These techniques helped improve both the aesthetics and usability of the interface.

Snippets:

```css
.blog-post-title:hover{
        color: #f4D04e;
}
```
```css
    #preview-card-container{
        width: 384px;
        height: 565px;
        background-color: #ffff;
        border-radius: 20px;
        border: 1px solid black;
        box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px #000;
        padding: 1.2rem;
        margin: 3rem auto;
}
```

### Continued development

As a frontend developer, I am keen to deepen my understanding of various **CSS styling methodologies** and techniques to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and performance of my projects. I want to explore advanced CSS concepts such as **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, **Custom Properties (CSS Variables)**, and **CSS Preprocessors** like **Sass** or **LESS** to streamline the styling process and create more modular and reusable code. Additionally, I'm interested in learning about **responsive design principles**, including **media queries**, to ensure consistent user experiences across different devices. Exploring **CSS frameworks** like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**, along with **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for naming conventions, will also help improve the consistency and efficiency of my workflow.
